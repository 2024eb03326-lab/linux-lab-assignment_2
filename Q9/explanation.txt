zombie.c:
This program creates multiple child processes using fork().
Each child exits after execution.

wait() is used in the parent process to collect the exit status
of terminated children, ensuring no zombie processes remain.

The parent prints the PID of each child it cleans up.
The program was executed using an online C compiler due to
local compiler unavailability.
