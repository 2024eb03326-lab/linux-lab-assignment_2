signal_handling.c:
This C program demonstrates handling signals in a parent process.

- Parent process runs indefinitely and installs handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT.
- Child 1 sleeps 5 seconds and sends SIGTERM to parent. Parent handles it and exits gracefully.
- Child 2 sleeps 10 seconds and sends SIGINT to parent. Parent handles it differently and ignores it.
- pause() is used in parent to wait for signals.
- The program was executed using an online C compiler due to local GCC unavailability.

Output:
- Parent PID printed at start
- Messages showing parent received SIGTERM and SIGINT
